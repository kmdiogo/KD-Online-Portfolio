# Kmdiogo's Online Portfolio
Hi, thanks for taking the time to look at my online portfolio! The page is based on a typical dark-themed IDE (mostly JetBrains products) and is meant to showcase my skills and experience as a Software Developer in a fun way!

## Navigation
To navigate the website, use the file navigator on the left hand side (or under the dropdown tab if on mobile) to access the different pages.

## Features
Feel free to explore the page, there are some interesting features I've included to make the showcase as interactive as possible:

### Command Line Interface
There is a button at the bottom of the website for a terminal. This is a functioning (but rather minimal) command line interface that allows you to navigate through my portfolio!

Currently, the terminal only supports 3 commands:

* cd - like most CLIs, this changes the working directory to the specified directory
* ls - lists out contents of current working directory
* open - loads the specified page by the given filename
* clear - clears the terminal

## Credits
This site was made using Vue.js with Bootstrap 4's grid system to help with responsive design.

The tour functionality was implemented using intro.js

Thanks to Matt Luonuansu for making the awesome logos for this portfolio!
